# Tcg Tournament (WIP)
App to create local tournaments, mostly Trading Card Games, but useful for any kind of game where a [Swiss-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) is desirable.</br>

It also includes player and tournament manager (once created, tournaments can be paused and resumed later).</br>

Scores and tiebreakers have been defined similar to [DCI Tournament procedure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_tnxziZ9rvoh6h5D9F9B125p8m8c9OI/view?usp=sharing).</br>

The project is being built making an extensive use of [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture), especially ViewModels, LiveData and Room.</br>

It also provides an UI that suits [Material Design](https://material.io/design) guidelines.</br>

(The app supports backwards compatibility to Android 4.1, API 16).
